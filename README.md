# Rim Width Calculator

This program analyzes shear wall schedules, and calculates the minimum allowed rim width per the tables shown in Weyerhaeuser's TB-206 document (dated 2021.09, expires 2023.03) based on material type, fastener type/size/spacing, quantity of fastener rows, etc.

This project is a work in process and will be updated. Stay tuned.
